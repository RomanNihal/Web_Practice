# Web Practice

Welcome to the **Web Practice** repository! üåêüíª

This project includes various web development practices I have worked on. It is a collection of simple web pages and projects where I‚Äôve explored and implemented different web technologies and design concepts. The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my progress and showcase practical examples of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**.

## Features

### 1. **HTML & CSS**:
   - Simple web pages with structured **HTML** and styled with **CSS**.
   - Various layouts, typography, and color schemes to practice responsive design and good HTML structure.

### 2. **JavaScript**:
   - Interactive elements, such as forms, buttons, and basic DOM manipulation.
   - Implemented simple features like pop-up messages, form validation, and event handling.

### 3. **PHP**:
   - Used **PHP** for server-side scripting.
   - Implemented dynamic pages such as form submissions, data validation, and simple CRUD operations.

### 4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Web pages designed to be responsive across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Media queries used to ensure layouts adapt to different devices.

### 5. **Practice Projects**:
   - Small projects and challenges, like a to-do list, personal portfolio, or interactive photo gallery, to demonstrate the use of basic web technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling, layouts, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactive functionality to the web pages.
- **PHP**: For server-side logic and dynamic content handling.
